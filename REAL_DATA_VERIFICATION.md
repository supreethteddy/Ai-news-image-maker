SELECT u.*, 
       COUNT(s.id) as storyboard_count,
       SUM(cp.amount_paid) as total_spent,
       COUNT(ct.id) as transaction_count
FROM user_profiles u
LEFT JOIN storyboards s ON u.id = s.user_id
LEFT JOIN credit_purchases cp ON u.id = cp.user_id
LEFT JOIN credit_transactions ct ON u.id = ct.user_id
GROUP BY u.id
```

### **Credit Management Tab:**
```sql
-- Real credit transactions
SELECT ct.*, up.name, up.email 
FROM credit_transactions ct
JOIN user_profiles up ON ct.user_id = up.id
ORDER BY ct.created_at DESC
